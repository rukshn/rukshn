### Hi there stalker 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile ✨

I'm Rukshan, currently following my MSc in Health Informatics or so I've been told. Even though I have been working on a COVID-19 ICU for the past few months.

I have no idea when I will return to my MSc 🙅‍♂️

Meanwhile I'm working on HyperTables an open-source project to create a UI for databases to easily perfom CURD actions inspired by AirTable and Excel.

I love working with Javascript, NodeJS and other web technologies.

I love making new things. If you have project which needs help let me know, I'm happy to provide you a hand.
